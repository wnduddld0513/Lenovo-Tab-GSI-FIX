# Lenovo-Tab-GSI-FIX
**by SMART ASW & MONE FIERA modded by wnduddld0513**

This Magisk module is useful when you are using GSI at Lenovo Tab(Tested on TB375FC (Dimensity 8300) LineageOS gsi 23).

### Following functions are available
- Retain Widevine L1
- Enables automatic brightness adjustment  
- Stylus pen (AP500U for PRC/ROW, PC-AC-AD042C for NEC) support  
- Disable apps related to phone/calls at once (to prevent cell standby).  
- Add option to enable “Double-Tap To Wake/DT2W” (selectable during installation).  
- Add option to select Maximum Refresh Rate (selectable between 120Hz and 144Hz).  
※Refresh Rate setting and whether DT2W is enabled can be checked in the module description field  

#### The following features have been removed in the latest version  
・Include TrebleApp to enable “Sleep/wake by magnetic cover” (removed because the latest GSI supports it by default)  
・Change GSI's props such as fingerprint to Legion Tab's props(~~Due to repeated crashes of some applications at [PixelOS GSI](https://github.com/MisterZtr/PixelOS_gsi/)~~)  

### Known Issues  
・Uninstalling the module will not reactivate the disabled application.  
　You have to restore it manually if necessary (but I don't think it's necessary...).
